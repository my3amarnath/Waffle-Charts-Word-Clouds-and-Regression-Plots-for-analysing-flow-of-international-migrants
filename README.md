# Data Visualization -  Waffle Charts, Word Clouds, and Regression Plots using seaborn

## Introduction
This project focuses onexploring and analysing flows of international migrants in canada.  The dataset contains annual data on the flows of international migrants as recorded by the countries of destination. The data presents both inflows and outflows according to the place of birth, citizenship or place of previous / next residence both for foreigners and nationals.

Dataset: Immigration to Canada from 1980 to 2013 - International migration flows to and from selected countries - The 2015 revision from United Nation's website

## Some Visualization Outputs

### Waffle Charts 

A waffle chart is an interesting visualization that is normally created to display progress toward goals. It is commonly an effective option when you are trying to add interesting visualization features to a visual that consists mainly of cells, such as an Excel dashboard.

### Word Clouds 

Word clouds (also known as text clouds or tag clouds) work in a simple way: the more a specific word appears in a source of textual data (such as a speech, blog post, or database), the bigger and bolder it appears in the word cloud.

An example that involves analyzing text data. Analyzed a short novel written by Lewis Carroll titled Alice's Adventures in Wonderland.

The majority of the people who immigrated came from one of 15 countries that are displayed by the word cloud.
